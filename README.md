## Problem Statement :
To create an informative AI-based tool that should be able to give alerts and identify cases of mental health issues in children and also track the improvement status in identified cases. It should be able to track mental health issues prevalent in children from birth to the ones which they acquired later in their life for remediation and counselling. The tool should support teacher’s assessment as well as parental and self-assessment.

As a result, there is a lot of misinformation and widely believed myths and stigmas about mental health. It is essential to bust these myths before we can begin to envision a mentally healthy society.</p></li>

<li><p>Efforts to maintain a balanced and healthy relationship with people who have panic or anxiety attacks begin with being thoroughly informed about them. Further, there are some tips and advice that people can follow to help a loved one dealing with panic or anxiety attacks.</p></li>
